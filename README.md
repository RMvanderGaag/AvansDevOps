# Design Patterns Project üõ†Ô∏è

In this project, we focus on applying a select group of design patterns that have been covered in our lessons. These patterns are instrumental in solving common design problems and enhancing code modularity and scalability.

## Patterns Overview üìö

### Creational Pattern:
- **Factory Pattern** ‚û°Ô∏è Encapsulates object creation logic to make the system independent of the process of instantiation.

### Behavioral/Structural Patterns:
- **State Pattern** ‚û°Ô∏è Allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes, appearing as if it changed its class.
- **Template Pattern** ‚û°Ô∏è Defines the program skeleton of an algorithm in an operation, deferring some steps to subclasses without changing the algorithm's structure.
- **Composite Pattern** ‚û°Ô∏è Composes objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies, allowing clients to treat individual objects and compositions uniformly.
- **Adapter Pattern** ‚û°Ô∏è Allows the interface of an existing class to be used as another interface, enabling classes to work together that couldn't otherwise because of incompatible interfaces.
